This research project was part of a larger research project with the same title led by Stephen Gray at Argonne. A significant amount of our work involved collaborations with Gray, and there were many joint publications as summarized later. In addition, a lot of this work involved collaborations with experimental groups at Northwestern, Argonne, and elsewhere. The research was primarily concerned with developing theory and computational methods that can be used to describe the interaction of light with noble metal nanoparticles (especially silver) that are capable of plasmon excitation. Classical electrodynamics provides a powerful approach for performing these studies, so much of this research project involved the development of methods for solving Maxwell’s equations, including both linear and nonlinear effects, and examining a wide range of nanostructures, including particles, particle arrays, metal films, films with holes, and combinations of metal nanostructures with polymers and other dielectrics. In addition, our work broke new ground in the development of quantum mechanical methods to describe plasmonic effects based on the use of time dependent density functional theory, and we developed new theory concerned with the coupling of plasmons to electrical transport in molecular wire structures. Applications of our technology were aimed at the development of plasmonic devices as components of optoelectronic circuits, plasmons for spectroscopy applications, and plasmons for energy-related applications.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Northwestern University, Evanston, IL</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2014-02-27</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage>Final</dc:coverage><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1121443, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1121443</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE-NU-ER15487</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>FG02-03ER15487</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther/><dc:doi>10.2172/1121443</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-05-12</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1121443</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1121443</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="3"><dc:title>No Title Yet (IEEE spectrum will provide the title).</dc:title><dc:creator>Wanke, Michael Clement; Lee, Mark</dc:creator><dc:subject/><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>Abstract not provided.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL-NM), Albuquerque, NM (United States)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2010-09-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: IEEE Spectrum; Related Information: Proposed for publication in IEEE Spectrum.</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: 9 p.</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1121923, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1121923</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>SAND2010-6597J</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC04-94AL85000</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>Other: 491272</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi/><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-03-06</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1121923</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="4"><dc:title>DEMAND CONTROLLED VENTILATION AND CLASSROOM VENTILATION</dc:title><dc:creator>Fisk, William J.; Mendell, Mark J.; Davies, Molly; Eliseeva, Ekaterina; Faulkner, David; Hong, Tienzen; Sullivan, Douglas P.</dc:creator><dc:subject>32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION : absence, buildings, carbon dioxide, demand-controlled ventilation, energy, indoor air quality, schools, ventilation</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated>: absence, buildings, carbon dioxide, demand-controlled ventilation, energy, indoor air quality, schools, ventilation</dc:subjectRelated><dc:description>This document summarizes a research effort on demand controlled ventilation and classroom ventilation. The research on demand controlled ventilation included field studies and building energy modeling. Major findings included: ? The single-location carbon dioxide sensors widely used for demand controlled ventilation frequently have large errors and will fail to effectively control ventilation rates (VRs).? Multi-location carbon dioxide measurement systems with more expensive sensors connected to multi-location sampling systems may measure carbon dioxide more accurately.? Currently-available optical people counting systems work well much of the time but have large counting errors in some situations. ? In meeting rooms, measurements of carbon dioxide at return-air grilles appear to be a better choice than wall-mounted sensors.? In California, demand controlled ventilation in general office spaces is projected to save significant energy and be cost effective only if typical VRs without demand controlled ventilation are very high relative to VRs in codes. Based on the research, several recommendations were developed for demand controlled ventilation specifications in the California Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards.The research on classroom ventilation collected data over two years on California elementary school classrooms to investigate associations between VRs and student illness absence (IA). Major findings included: ? Median classroom VRs in all studied climate zones were below the California guideline, and 40percent lower in portable than permanent buildings.? Overall, one additional L/s per person of VR was associated with 1.6percent less IA. ? Increasing average VRs in California K-12 classrooms from the current average to the required level is estimated to decrease IA by 3.4percent, increasing State attendance-based funding to school districts by $33M, with $6.2 M in increased energy costs. Further VR increases would provide additional benefits.? Confirming these findings in intervention studies is recommended. ? Energy costs of heating/cooling unoccupied classrooms statewide are modest, but a large portion occurs in relatively few classrooms.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA (US)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>Environmental Energy Technologies Division</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2014-01-06</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED; Size: 138</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1127147, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1127147</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>LBNL-6563E</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC02-05CH11231</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther/><dc:doi>10.2172/1127147</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-05-12</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1127147</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1127147</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="5"><dc:title>Addendum to the Corrective Action Decision Document/Closure Report for Corrective Action Unit 529: Area 25 Contaminated Materials, Nevada Test Site, Nevada, Revision 1</dc:title><dc:creator>Krauss, Mark J</dc:creator><dc:subject>54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES CADD/CR; CAU 529; Area 25; Contaminated Materials; Addendum</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated>CADD/CR; CAU 529; Area 25; Contaminated Materials; Addendum</dc:subjectRelated><dc:description>This document constitutes an addendum to the Corrective Action Decision Document/Closure Report for Corrective Action Unit 529: Area 25 Contaminated Materials, Nevada Test Site, Nevada as described in the document Recommendations and Justifications To Remove Use Restrictions Established under the U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Field Office Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order dated September 2013.

The program was organized by Steve Long (University of Illinois) and Nick Carpita (Purdue University), along with co-organizers Marcos Buckeridge (University of São Paulo, Brazil) and Federico Sánchez (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México). More than 200 scientists from over a dozen nations around the world gathered to discuss key issues surrounding the development of biofuel feedstocks and to report on their research in this area. This three day conference had invited speakers surrounding developing renewable and sustainable energy resources which are typically propelled by three important drivers – security, cost and environmental impact. The first day of the conference was delegated to governmental policy makers and designers of national research and plant biologists, agronomists, microbiologists, economists and ecologists in relation to bioenergy security in the Western Hemisphere that is sustainable and ecologically and economically sound. Speakers from countries that have already made themselves energy independent shared solutions to improve efficiency that is being researched. Venture capitalist and industry leaders also spoke on their commitment to economic success in a new green agroindustry. Days two and three explored bioenergy crops and introduced the participants to the breadth of the agricultural landscape, the underlying biology of bioenergy plants and new ideas to enhance biomass yield and quality of the energy crops of the future. These presentations educated the participants in an effort to develop energy strategies in countries across the world that become energy independent while developing economic growth and clean, reliable and affordable energy. Presenters educated student on reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, improving fuel efficiencies, indigenous energy alternative such as ethanol and improving bioenergy crop plants. Sessions surrounding developing bioenergy crop plants were held relating to the growth and development, cell wall synthesis and architecture to improve the next generation of energy plants. This grant was used to supplement registration and provide lodging support for graduate students, post-doctorals, and early career scientists attending the congress. Among these awardees partially funded by DOE and other agencies were 18 individuals, including nine graduate students, two post-doctorals, and seven early career scientists. The PIs on the grant worked closely with the Minority Affairs and International committees of ASPB to identify appropriate travel awardees; among the 18 awardees, nine were female, and two were African-American.

The project, a prototype house built by K. Hovnanian Homes' Ontario Group, is located in Lake Elsinore, Riverside County, California, and achieves a 50% level of whole house source energy savings with respect to the Building America (BA) Benchmark Definition 2009 (Hendron and Engebrecht 2010). Temperature measurements in three rooms indicate that the temperature difference between the measured locations and the thermostat were within recommendations 90.3% of the time in heating mode and 99.3% of the time in cooling mode. The air distribution system is operating efficiently with average delivered temperatures adequate to facilitate proper heating and cooling and only minor average temperature differences observed between the system's plenum and farthest register. Monitored energy use results for the house indicate that it is using less energy than predicted from modeling. A breakdown of energy use according to end use determined little agreement between comparable values.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, CO.</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Building Technologies Program</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-08-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Related Information: Work performed by IBACOS, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED; Size: 23 pp.</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1090960, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1090960</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE/GO-102013-3956</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>AC36-08GO28308</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>Other: LNDJ-0-40341-00</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/1090960</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-08-29</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1090960</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1090960</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="12"><dc:title>Transportation Energy Data Book: Edition 32</dc:title><dc:creator>Davis, Stacy Cagle [ORNL] [ORNL]; Diegel, Susan W [ORNL] [ORNL]; Boundy, Robert Gary [ORNL] [ORNL]</dc:creator><dc:subject>Energy Transportation Vehicles Emissions Petroleum Gasoline Trucks Cars Fuel Miles Travel</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated>Energy Transportation Vehicles Emissions Petroleum Gasoline Trucks Cars Fuel Miles Travel</dc:subjectRelated><dc:description>The Transportation Energy Data Book: Edition 32 is a statistical compendium prepared and published by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technologies Office.

It is obtained using double many-body expansion theory and an extensive set of accurate ab initio energies extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. Such a work can be recommended for dynamics studies of the N({sup 2}D) + H{sub 2} reaction, a reliable theoretical treatment of the photodissociation dynamics and as building blocks for constructing the double many-body expansion potential energy surface of larger nitrogen/hydrogen containing systems. In turn, a preliminary theoretical study of the reaction N({sup 2}D)+H{sub 2}(X{sup 1}Σ{sub g}{sup +})(ν=0,j=0)→NH(a{sup 1}Δ)+H({sup 2}S) has been carried out with the method of quasi-classical trajectory on the new potential energy surface. Integral cross sections and thermal rate constants have been calculated, providing perhaps the most reliable estimate of the integral cross sections and the rate constants known thus far for such a reaction.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-10-21</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Physics; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: (c) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: page(s) 154305-154305.7</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22220399, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22220399</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9606; CODEN: JCPSA6; TRN: US14A0474041354</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1063/1.4824188</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-04-28</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22220399</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="14"><dc:title>Emissions Inventory Report Summary for Los Alamos National Laboratory for Calendar Year 2009</dc:title><dc:creator>Environmental Stewardship Group</dc:creator><dc:subject>54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; AIR POLLUTION; CALENDARS; CARBON MONOXIDE; LANL; NITROGEN OXIDES; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; PARTICULATES; POLLUTANTS; REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; SULFUR OXIDES</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is subject to annual emissions reporting requirements for regulated air pollutants under Title 20 of the New Mexico Administrative Code, Chapter 2, Part 73 (20.2.73 NMAC), Notice of Intent and Emissions Inventory Requirements. The applicability of the requirements is based on the Laboratory's potential to emit 100 tons per year of suspended particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, or volatile organic compounds. Additionally, on April 30, 2004, LANL was issued a Title V Operating Permit from the New Mexico Environment Department/Air Quality Bureau, under 20.2.70 NMAC. This permit was modified and reissued on July 16, 2007. This Title V Operating Permit (Permit No. P-100M2) includes emission limits and operating limits for all regulated sources of air pollution at LANL. The Title V Operating Permit also requires semiannual emissions reporting for all sources included in the permit. This report summarizes both the annual emissions inventory reporting and the semiannual emissions reporting for LANL for calendar year 2009. LANL's 2009 emissions are well below the emission limits in the Title V Operating Permit.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2010-10-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED; Size: 3 Mb</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1012904, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1012904</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>LA-14430-SR</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC52-06NA25396</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US201122%%425</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/1012904</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-02-03</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1012904</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="text/html">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1012904</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="15"><dc:title>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Site Radionuclide Air Emissions Report for Calendar Year 2012</dc:title><dc:creator>Snyder, Sandra F.; Barnett, J.

Using 6080 ab initio single-point energies of all the regions for the dynamics, a many-body expansion function form has been used to fit these points. The quantum reactive scattering dynamics calculations taking into account the Coriolis coupling (CC) were carried out on the new potential energy surface over a range of collision energies (0.03-1.0 eV). The reaction probabilities and integral cross sections for the title reaction were calculated. The significance of including the CC quantum scattering calculation has been revealed by the comparison between the CC and the centrifugal sudden approximation calculation. The calculated cross section is in agreement with the experimental result at collision energy 1.0 eV.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-05-07</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Physics; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: (c) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: page(s) 174305-174305.8</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22105516, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22105516</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9606; CODEN: JCPSA6; TRN: US13A4425063337</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1063/1.4803116</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-07-18</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22105516</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="18"><dc:title>PATHWAYS OF LARGE-SCALE MAGNETIC COUPLINGS BETWEEN SOLAR CORONAL EVENTS</dc:title><dc:creator>Schrijver, Carolus J.; Title, Alan M.; DeRosa, Marc L.

In some cases, sets of coronal events are evidently causally related, while in many other instances indirect evidence can be found. We present case studies to highlight a variety of coupling processes involved in coronal events. We find that physical linkages between events do occur, but concur with earlier studies that these couplings appear to be crucial to understanding the initiation of major eruptive or explosive phenomena relatively infrequently. We note that the post-eruption reconfiguration timescale of the large-scale corona, estimated from the extreme-ultraviolet afterglow, is on average longer than the mean time between coronal mass ejections (CMEs), so that many CMEs originate from a corona that is still adjusting from a previous event. We argue that the coronal field is intrinsically global: current systems build up over days to months, the relaxation after eruptions continues over many hours, and evolving connections easily span much of a hemisphere. This needs to be reflected in our modeling of the connections from the solar surface into the heliosphere to properly model the solar wind, its perturbations, and the generation and propagation of solar energetic particles. However, the large-scale field cannot be constructed reliably by currently available observational resources. We assess the potential of high-quality observations from beyond Earth's perspective and advanced global modeling to understand the couplings between coronal events in the context of CMEs and solar energetic particle events.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/93</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-08-20</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 773; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: [20 page(s)]</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22131035, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22131035</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; CODEN: ASJOAB; TRN: US13Q4559086159</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/93</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-10-10</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22131035</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="19"><dc:title>Nevada National Security Site Radiation Protection Program</dc:title><dc:creator>none,</dc:creator><dc:subject>61 RADIATION PROTECTION AND DOSIMETRY radiation protection, Nevada National Security Site, NNSS</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated>radiation protection, Nevada National Security Site, NNSS</dc:subjectRelated><dc:description>Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 835, “Occupational Radiation Protection,” establishes radiation protection standards, limits, and program requirements for protecting individuals from ionizing radiation resulting from the conduct of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) activities. 10 CFR 835.101(a) mandates that DOE activities be conducted in compliance with a documented Radiation Protection Program (RPP) as approved by DOE.

M</dc:creator><dc:subject>42 ENGINEERING</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>Currently, thousands of model 9975 transportation packages are in use by the US Department of Energy (DOE); the design of which has been certified by DOE for shipment of Type B radioactive and fissile materials in accordance with Part 71, Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), or 10 CFR 71, Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive Material. These transportation packages are also approved for the storage of DOE-STD-3013 containers at the Savannah River Site (SRS). As such, the 9975 has been continuously exposed to the service environment for a period of time greater than the approved transportation service life. In order to ensure the material integrity as specified in the safety basis, an extensive surveillance program is in place in K-Area Complex (KAC) to monitor the structural and thermal properties of the fiberboard of the 9975 shipping packages. The surveillance approach uses a combination of Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) field surveillance and Destructive Examination (DE) lab testing to validate the 9975 performance assumptions. The fiberboard in the 9975 is credited with thermal insulation, criticality control and resistance to crushing. During surveillance monitoring in KAC, an increased axial gap of the fiberboard was discovered on selected items packaged at Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). Many of these packages were later found to contain excess moisture. Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) testing has resulted in a better understanding of the relationship between the fiberboard moisture level and compaction of the fiberboard under storage conditions and during transport. In laboratory testing, the higher moisture content has been shown to correspond to higher total compaction of fiberboard material and compaction rate. The fiberboard height is reduced by compression of the layers. This change is observed directly in the axial gap between the flange and the air shield.

Compliance with thermal design requirements can be met by prototype tests, analyses only or a combination of tests and analyses. Normally, it is impractical to meet all the HAC using tests only and the analytical methods are too complex due to the multi-physics non-linear nature of the fire event. Therefore, a combination of tests and thermal analyses methods using commercial heat transfer software are used to meet the necessary design requirements. The authors, along with his other colleagues at Savannah River National Laboratory in Aiken, SC, USA, have successfully used this &amp;#x27;tests and analyses&amp;#x27; approach in the design and certification of several United States&amp;#x27; DOE/NNSA certified packages, e.g. 9975, 9977, 9978, 9979, H1700, and Bulk Tritium Shipping Package (BTSP). This paper will describe these methods and it is hoped that the RAM Type B package designers and analysts can use them for their applications.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE (United States)</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-03-28</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Conference</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Conference: ASME 2013 Pressure Vessels And Piping Conference, Paris (France), 14-18 Jul 2013</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1072351, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1072351</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>SRNL-STI--2013-00184</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC09-08SR22470</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US1300270</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi/><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-04-03</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1072351</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1072351</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="26"><dc:title>Ca{sub 2}Pd{sub 3}Ge, a new fully ordered ternary Laves phase structure</dc:title><dc:creator>Doverbratt, Isa, E-mail: isa.doverbratt@polymat.lth.se [Centre for Analysis and Synthesis, Lund University, P.O.

The research associated with this paper hypothesizes that a user interface and complementary radiation compatible robotic hand that integrates the human hand’s anthropometric properties, speed capability, nonlinear strength profile, reduction of active degrees of freedom during the transition from manipulation to grasping, and just noticeable difference force sensation characteristics will enhance a user’s teleoperation performance. The main contribution of this research is in that a system that concisely integrates all these factors has yet to be developed and furthermore has yet to be applied to a hazardous environment as those referenced above. In fact, the most prominent slave manipulator teleoperation technology in use today is based on a design patented in 1945 (Patent 2632574) [1]. The robotic hand/user interface systems of similar function as the one being developed in this research limit their design input requirements in the best case to only complementing the hand’s anthropometric properties, speed capability, and linearly scaled force application relationship (e.g. robotic force is a constant, 4 times that of the user). In this paper a nonlinear relationship between the force experienced between the user interface and the robotic hand was devised based on property differences of manipulation and grasping activities as they pertain to the human hand. The results show that such a relationship when subjected to a manipulation task and grasping task produces increased performance compared to the traditional linear scaling techniques used by other systems.

Single crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals a statistical mixing of Cr/Al in their crystallographic positions. Single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction as well as energy dispersive X-ray analyses suggested the title phase to have a narrow homogeneity range. The substructure of Zn{sub 13}(Cr{sub x}Al{sub 1-x}){sub 27} shows close resemblance with the Mn{sub 3}Al{sub 10} structure type.

The relative population of the two lowest H{sub 2} rotational states, j = 0 and 1, has been varied systematically. NH{sup +} formation is nearly thermo-neutral; however, to date, the energetics are not known with the accuracy required for low-temperature astrochemistry. Additional complications arise from the fact that, so far, there is no reliable theoretical or experimental information on how the reactivity of the N{sup +} ion depends on its fine-structure (FS) state {sup 3} P{sub ja} . Since in the present trapping experiment, thermalization of the initially hot FS population competes with hydrogen abstraction, the evaluation of the decay of N{sup +} ions over long storage times and at various He and H{sub 2} gas densities provides information on these processes. First assuming strict adiabatic behavior, a set of state specific rate coefficients is derived from the measured thermal rate coefficients. In addition, by recording the disappearance of the N{sup +} ions over several orders of magnitude, information on nonadiabatic transitions is extracted including FS-changing collisions.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/768/1/86</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-05-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 768; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: [8 page(s)]</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22126785, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22126785</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; CODEN: ASJOAB; TRN: US13P1765081864</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1088/0004-637X/768/1/86</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-10-10</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22126785</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="38"><dc:title>Interim Status Closure Plan Open Burning Treatment Unit Technical Area 16-399 Burn Tray</dc:title><dc:creator>Vigil-Holterman, Luciana R.

This represents potential energy savings of about 140 GWh of electricity and 83 million therms of natural gas as well as proportional peak savings in California. The RIVEC controller is intended to meet the 2008 Title 24 requirements for residential ventilation as well as taking into account the issues of outdoor conditions, other ventilation devices (including economizers), peak demand concerns and occupant preferences. The controller is designed to manage all the residential ventilation systems that are currently available. A key innovation in this controller is the ability to implement the concept of efficacy and intermittent ventilation which allows time shifting of ventilation. Using this approach ventilation can be shifted away from times of high cost or high outdoor pollution towards times when it is cheaper and more effective. Simulations, based on the ones used to develop the new residential ventilation requirements for the California Buildings Energy code, were used to further define the specific criteria and strategies needed for the controller. These simulations provide estimates of the energy, peak power and contaminant improvement possible for different California climates for the various ventilation systems. Results from a field test of the prototype controller corroborate the predicted performance.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA (US)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>Environmental Energy Technologies Division</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2011-12-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1082205, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1082205</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>LBNL-5401E</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC02-05CH11231</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther/><dc:doi>10.2172/1082205</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-09-26</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1082205</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1082205</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="40"><dc:title>Emissions inventory report summary for Los Alamos National Laboratory for calendar year 2008</dc:title><dc:creator>Ecology and Air Quality Group</dc:creator><dc:subject>54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; AIR POLLUTION; CALENDARS; CARBON MONOXIDE; NITROGEN OXIDES; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; PARTICULATES; POLLUTANTS; REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; SULFUR OXIDES</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is subject to annual emissions reporting requirements for regulated air pollutants under Title 20 of the New Mexico Administrative Code, Chapter 2, Part 73 (20.2.73 NMAC), Notice of Intent and Emissions Inventory Requirements. The applicability of the requirements is based on the Laboratory’s potential to emit 100 tons per year of suspended particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, or volatile organic compounds. Additionally, on April 30, 2004, LANL was issued a Title V Operating Permit from the New Mexico Environment Department/Air Quality Bureau, under 20.2.70 NMAC. This permit was modified and reissued on July 16, 2007. This Title V Operating Permit (Permit No. P-100M2) includes emission limits and operating limits for all regulated sources of air pollution at LANL. The Title V Operating Permit also requires semiannual emissions reporting for all sources included in the permit. This report summarizes both the annual emissions inventory reporting and the semiannual emissions reporting for LANL for calendar year 2008. LANL’s 2008 emissions are well below the emission limits in the Title V Operating Permit.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2009-10-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED; Size: 8.6 MB</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 967074, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 967074</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>LA-14408-SR</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC52-06NA25396</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US200923%%99</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/967074</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2009-12-17</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>967074</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/967074</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="41"><dc:title>HUD PowerSaver Pilot Loan Program</dc:title><dc:creator>Zimring, Mark; Hoffman, Ian</dc:creator><dc:subject>29; COMMUNITIES; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; INSURANCE; TARGETS</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently announced the creation of a pilot loan program for home energy improvements.

In this paper, we analyze a set of rapidly evolving loops that appear in an inter-moss region. We select six loops that both appear in and fade out of the Hi-C images during the short flight. From the Hi-C data, we determine the size and lifetimes of the loops and characterize whether these loops appear simultaneously along their length or first appear at one footpoint before appearing at the other. Using co-aligned, co-temporal data from multiple channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we determine the temperature and density of the loops. We find the loops consist of cool ({approx}10{sup 5} K), dense ({approx}10{sup 10} cm{sup -3}) plasma. Their required thermal energy and their observed evolution suggest they result from impulsive heating similar in magnitude to nanoflares. Comparisons with advanced numerical simulations indicate that such dense, cold and short-lived loops are a natural consequence of impulsive magnetic energy release by reconnection of braided magnetic field at low heights in the solar atmosphere.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/771/1/21</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-07-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 771; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: [10 page(s)]</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22140234, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22140234</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; CODEN: ASJOAB; TRN: US13P8831094781</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1088/0004-637X/771/1/21</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-10-17</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22140234</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="44"><dc:title>Regulatory Perspective on Potential Fuel Reconfiguration and Its Implication to High Burnup Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation - 13042</dc:title><dc:creator>Li, Zhian; Rahimi, Meraj; Tang, David; Aissa, Mourad; Flaganan, Michelle [U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission - NRC, Washington, DC 20555-0001 (United States)] [U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission - NRC, Washington, DC 20555-0001 (United States)]; Wagner, John C.

The experiment results also show that the ductile to brittle temperature increases as the fuel burnup increases. These results indicate that the current knowledge in cladding material property is insufficient to determine the structural performance of the cladding of high burnup fuel after it has been stored in a dry cask storage system for some time. The uncertainties in material property and the elevated ductile to brittle transition temperature impose a challenge to the storage cask and transportation packaging designs because the cask designs may not be able to rely on the structural integrity of the fuel assembly for control of fissile material, radiation source, and decay heat source distributions. The fuel may reconfigure during further storage and/or the subsequent transportation conditions. In addition, the fraction of radioactive materials available for release from spent fuel under normal condition of storage and transport may also change. The spent fuel storage and/or transportation packaging vendors, spent fuel shippers, and the regulator may need to consider this possible fuel reconfiguration and its impact on the packages' ability to meet the safety requirements of Part 72 and Part 71 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is working with the scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to assess the impact of fuel reconfiguration on the safety of the dry storage systems and transportation packages. The NRC Division of Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation has formed a task force to work on the safety and regulatory concerns in relevance to high burnup fuel storage and transportation. This paper discusses the staff's preliminary considerations on the safety implication of fuel reconfiguration with respect to nuclear safety (subcriticality control), radiation shielding, containment, the performance of the thermal functions of the packages, and the retrievability of the contents from regulatory perspective.

It is realized that, since late 1990's, improvement of the regulatory framework for decommissioning has been emphasized constantly from the point of view of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s safety standards. And it is known that now IAEA prepare the safety requirement on decommissioning of facilities, its title is the Safe Decommissioning of Facilities, General Safety Requirement Part 6. According to the result of IAEA's Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) mission to Korea in 2011, it was recommended that the regulatory framework for decommissioning should require decommissioning plans for nuclear installations to be constructed and operated and these plans should be updated periodically. In addition, after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in March of 2011, preparedness for early decommissioning caused by an unexpected severe accident became also important issues and concerns. In this respect, it is acknowledged that the regulatory framework for decommissioning of nuclear facilities in Korea need to be improved. First of all, we identify the current status and relevant issues of regulatory framework for decommissioning of nuclear power plants compared to the IAEA's safety standards in order to achieve our goal. And then the plan is to be established for improvement of regulatory framework for decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Korea. After dealing with it, it is expected that the revised regulatory framework for decommissioning could enhance the safety regime on the decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Korea in light of international standards.

These ISFSIs, which include operating and decommissioned reactor sites, Department of Energy facilities in Idaho, and others, are licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 72. The SNF is stored in dry cask storage systems, which most commonly consist of a welded austenitic stainless steel canister within a larger concrete vault or overpack vented to the external atmosphere to allow airflow for cooling. Some ISFSIs are located in marine environments where there may be high concentrations of airborne chloride salts. If salts were to deposit on the canisters via the external vents, a chloride-rich brine could form by deliquescence. Austenitic stainless steels are susceptible to chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC), particularly in the presence of residual tensile stresses from welding or other fabrication processes. SCC could allow helium to leak out of a canister if the wall is breached or otherwise compromise its structural integrity. There is currently limited understanding of the conditions that will affect the SCC susceptibility of austenitic stainless steel exposed to marine salts. NRC previously conducted a scoping study of this phenomenon, reported in NUREG/CR-7030 in 2010. Given apparent conservatisms and limitations in this study, NRC has sponsored a follow-on research program to more systematically investigate various factors that may affect SCC including temperature, humidity, salt concentration, and stress level. The activities within this research program include: (1) measurement of relative humidity (RH) for deliquescence of sea salt, (2) SCC testing within the range of natural absolute humidity, (3) SCC testing at elevated temperatures, (4) SCC testing at high humidity conditions, and (5) SCC testing with various applied stresses. Results to date indicate that the deliquescence RH for sea salt is close to that of MgCl{sub 2} pure salt. SCC is observed between 35 and 80 deg. C when the ambient (RH) is close to or higher than this level, even for a low surface salt concentration.

A robust program is in place to remove waste from these tanks, treat the waste to separate into a relatively small volume of high-level waste and a large volume of low-level waste, and to actively dispose of the low-level waste on-site and close the waste tanks and associated ancillary structures. To support performance-based, risk-informed decision making and to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its current and past contractors have worked closely with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to develop and implement a framework for on-site low-level waste disposal and closure of the SRS waste tanks. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, provides DOE the authority to manage defense-related radioactive waste. DOE Order 435.1 and its associated manual and guidance documents detail this radioactive waste management process. The DOE also has a requirement to consult with the NRC in determining that waste that formerly was classified as high-level waste can be safely managed as either low-level waste or transuranic waste. Once DOE makes a determination, NRC then has a responsibility to monitor DOE's actions in coordination with SCDHEC to ensure compliance with the Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 61 (10CFR61), Subpart C performance objectives. The management of hazardous waste substances or components at SRS is regulated by SCDHEC and the EPA. The foundation for the interactions between DOE, SCDHEC and EPA is the SRS Federal Facility Agreement (FFA). Managing this array of requirements and successfully interacting with regulators, consultants and stakeholders is a challenging task but ensures thorough and thoughtful processes for disposing of the SRS low-level waste and the closure of the tank farm facilities.

The Hi-C observations show in some moss regions variability on timescales down to {approx}15 s, significantly shorter than the minute-scale variability typically found in previous observations of moss, therefore challenging the conclusion of moss being heated in a mostly steady manner. These rapid variability moss regions are located at the footpoints of bright hot coronal loops observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly in the 94 A channel, and by the Hinode/X-Ray Telescope. The configuration of these loops is highly dynamic, and suggestive of slipping reconnection. We interpret these events as signatures of heating events associated with reconnection occurring in the overlying hot coronal loops, i.e., coronal nanoflares. We estimate the order of magnitude of the energy in these events to be of at least a few 10{sup 23} erg, also supporting the nanoflare scenario. These Hi-C observations suggest that future observations at comparable high spatial and temporal resolution, with more extensive temperature coverage, are required to determine the exact characteristics of the heating mechanism(s).</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2041-8205/770/1/L1</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-06-10</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal Letters; Journal Volume: 770; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: [7 page(s)]</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22118801, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22118801</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 2041-8205; TRN: US13P9943075437</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1088/2041-8205/770/1/L1</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-09-05</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22118801</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="50"><dc:title>National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants - Radionuclide Emissions Calendar Year 2012</dc:title><dc:creator>Warren, R.</dc:creator><dc:subject>12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES emission, NESHAP, 2012, Nevada</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated>emission, NESHAP, 2012, Nevada</dc:subjectRelated><dc:description>The U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Field Office (NNSA/NFO) operates the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) and North Las Vegas Facility (NLVF). From 1951 through 1992, the NNSS was the continental testing location for U.S. nuclear weapons. The release of radionuclides from NNSS activities has been monitored since the initiation of atmospheric testing. Limitation to underground detonations after 1962 greatly reduced radiation exposure to the public surrounding the NNSS. After nuclear testing ended in 1992, NNSS radiation monitoring focused on detecting airborne radionuclides from historically contaminated soils. These radionuclides are derived from re-suspension of soil (primarily by wind) and emission of tritium-contaminated soil moisture through evapotranspiration. Low amounts of legacy-related tritium are also emitted to air at the NLVF, an NNSS support complex in North Las Vegas. To protect the public from harmful levels of man-made radiation, the Clean Air Act, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) (Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 61 Subpart H) (CFR 2010a) limits the release of radioactivity from a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility to that which would cause 10 millirem per year (mrem/yr) effective dose equivalent to any member of the public. This limit does not include radiation unrelated to NNSS activities. Unrelated doses could come from naturally occurring radioactive elements, from sources such as medically or commercially used radionuclides, or from sources outside of the United States, such as the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011. NNSA/NFO demonstrates compliance with the NESHAP limit by using environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations on the NNSS (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] and DOE 1995). This method was approved by the EPA for use on the NNSS in 2001 (EPA 2001a) and has been the sole method used since 2005. Six locations on the NNSS have been established to act as critical receptor locations to demonstrate compliance with the NESHAP limit. These locations are actually pseudo-critical receptor stations, because no member of the public actually resides at these onsite locations. Compliance is demonstrated if the measured annual average concentration is less than the NESHAP Concentration Levels (CLs) for Environmental Compliance listed in 40 CFR 61, Appendix E, Table 2 (CFR 2010a). For multiple radionuclides, compliance is demonstrated when the sum of the fractions (determined by dividing each radionuclide’s concentration by its CL and then adding the fractions together) is less than 1.0. In 2012, the potential dose from radiological emissions to air, resulting from both current and past NNSS activities, was well below the 10 mrem/yr dose limit. Air sampling data collected at all air monitoring stations had average concentrations of radioactivity that were a fraction of the CL values. Concentrations ranged from less than 0.5% to a maximum of 11.1% of the allowed NESHAP limit. Because the nearest member of the public resides about 9 kilometers from potential release points on the NNSS, dose to the public would be only a small fraction of the value measured on the NNSS. The potential dose to the public from NLVF emissions was also very low at 0.000024 mrem/yr, more than 400,000 times lower than the 10 mrem/yr limit.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Nevada Test Site/National Security Technologies, LLC (United States)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-06-10</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1087078, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1087078</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE/NV/25946--1796</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC52-06NA25946</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther/><dc:doi>10.2172/1087078</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-07-18</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1087078</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1087078</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="51"><dc:title>Poly[bis(N,N-dimethylformamide-[kappa]O)([mu]4-naphthalene-1,5-disulfonato)magnesium(II)]</dc:title><dc:creator>Borkowski, Lauren A.; Banerjee, Debasis; Parise, John B.

The purpose of the grant was for improvements to be made at the City’s hydroelectric generating facility located on the Arkansas River. Improvements were to be made through the installation of an intake maintenance device (IMD) and the purchase of a large capacity wood grinder. The wood grinder was purchased in order to receive the tree limbs, tree trunks, and other organic debris that collects at the intake of the plant during high flow. The wood grinder eliminates the periodic burning of the waste material that is cleared from the intake and reduces any additional air pollution to the area. The resulting organic mulch has been made available to the public at no charge. Design discussion and planning began immediately and the wood grinder was purchased in July of 2010 and immediately put to work mulching debris that was gathered regularly from the intake of the facility. The mulch is currently available to the public for free. A large majority of the design process was spent in discussion with the Corps of Engineers to obtain approval for drawings, documents, and permits that were required in order to make changes to the structure of the powerhouse. In April of 2011, the City’s Project Engineer, who had overseen the application, resigned and left the City’s employ. A new Systems Mechanical Engineer was hired and tasked with overseeing the project. The transfer of responsibility led to a re-examination of the original assumptions and research upon which the grant proposal was based. At that point, the project went under review and a trip was booked for July 2011 to visit facilities that currently had an IMD installed. This further study of facilities revealed that the implementation of the project as originally described, while proving the benefits described in the original grant application, would likely intensify sand intake. Increased sand intake would lead to an increase in required shutdowns for maintenance and more rapid depreciation of key equipment which would result in a loss of generation capacity. A better solution to the problem, one that continued to meet the criteria for the original grant and ARRA standards, was developed. A supporting day trip was planned to visit other facilities located on the Arkansas River to determine how they were coping with the same strong amounts of sand, silt, and debris. Upon returning from the trip to other Arkansas River facilities it was extremely clear what direction to go in order to most efficiently address the issue of generator capacity and efficiency. Of the plants visited on the Arkansas River, every one of them was running what is called a rope packing shaft sealing system as opposed to mechanical shaft seals, which the facility was running. Rope packing is a time proven sealing method that has been around for centuries. It has proved to perform very well in dirty water situations just like that of the Arkansas River. In April of 2012 a scope change proposal was submitted to the DOE for approval. In August of 2012 the City received word that the change of scope had been approved. Plans were immediately set in motion to begin the conversion from mechanical seals to a packing box at the facility. Contractors arrived on October 1st, 2012 and the project team began unwatering the unit for disassembly. The seal conversion was completed on February 29th, 2013 with start-up of the unit. Further testing and adjusting was done throughout the first two weeks of March.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>City of North Little Rock</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-05-29</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage>Final</dc:coverage><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1082902, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1082902</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOEEE0002674</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>EE0002674</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther/><dc:doi>10.2172/1082902</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-06-20</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1082902</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1082902</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="54"><dc:title>Talking the Higgs Boson with Dr. Joseph Incandela: Third Lecture in the DOE Science Speaker Series (includes opening remarks from Dr. Bill Brinkman and introduction by Energy Secretary, Dr. Steven Chu)</dc:title><dc:creator>Incandela, Joseph (Spokesperon for the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment at Large Hadron Collider) [Spokesperon for the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment at Large Hadron Collider]</dc:creator><dc:subject>72 PHYSICS OF ELEMENTARY PARTICLES AND FIELDS; ENGINEERS; FIBERS; INVENTIONS; MONOCRYSTALS; ORNL; ROLLING; SUBSTRATES; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; SUPERCONDUCTORS; TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER; TRANSPORT</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>In July of 2012, scientists leading two different research teams, working independently of each other, announced that they had almost certain proof of the long-sought Higgs boson.

Previous observations of these flows primarily come from Hα and cool extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lines (e.g., 304 Å) where estimates of the size of the prominence threads has been limited by the resolution of the available instrumentation. Evidence of 'counter-steaming' flows has previously been inferred from these cool plasma observations, but now, for the first time, these flows have been directly imaged along fundamental filament threads within the million degree corona (at 193 Å). In this work, we present observations of an AR filament observed with the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) that exhibits anti-parallel flows along adjacent filament threads. Complementary data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager are presented. The ultra-high spatial and temporal resolution of Hi-C allow the anti-parallel flow velocities to be measured (70-80 km s{sup –1}) and gives an indication of the resolvable thickness of the individual strands (0.''8 ± 0.''1). The temperature of the plasma flows was estimated to be log T (K) = 5.45 ± 0.10 using Emission Measure loci analysis. We find that SDO/AIA cannot clearly observe these anti-parallel flows or measure their velocity or thread width due to its larger pixel size. We suggest that anti-parallel/counter-streaming flows are likely commonplace within all filaments and are currently not observed in EUV due to current instrument spatial resolution.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2041-8205/775/1/L32</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-09-20</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal Letters; Journal Volume: 775; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: [6 page(s)]</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22224073, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22224073</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 2041-8205; TRN: US13I2783045028</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1088/2041-8205/775/1/L32</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-05-01</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22224073</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="56"><dc:title>New MEA Materials for Improved DMFC Performance, Durability and Cost</dc:title><dc:creator>Fletcher, James H.

[University of North Florida]</dc:creator><dc:subject>08 HYDROGEN Fuel cell, Hydrogen</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated>Fuel cell, Hydrogen</dc:subjectRelated><dc:description>Abstract Project Title: New MEA Materials for Improved DMFC Performance, Durability and Cost The University of North Florida (UNF)--with project partners the University of Florida, Northeastern University, and Johnson Matthey--has recently completed the Department of Energy (DOE) project entitled “New MEA Materials for Improved DMFC Performance, Durability and Cost”. The primary objective of the project was to advance portable fuel cell MEA technology towards the commercial targets as laid out in the DOE R&amp;D roadmap by developing a passive water recovery MEA (membrane electrode assembly). Developers at the University of North Florida identified water management components as an insurmountable barrier to achieving the required system size and weight necessary to achieve the energy density requirements of small portable power applications. UNF developed an innovative “passive water recovery” MEA for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) which provides a path to system simplification and optimization. The passive water recovery MEA incorporates a hydrophobic, porous, barrier layer within the cathode electrode, so that capillary pressure forces the water produced at the cathode through holes in the membrane and back to the anode. By directly transferring the water from the cathode to the anode, the balance of plant is very much simplified and the need for heavy, bulky water recovery components is eliminated. At the heart of the passive water recovery MEA is the UNF DM-1 membrane that utilizes a hydrocarbon structure to optimize performance in a DMFC system. The membrane has inherent performance advantages, such as a low methanol crossover (high overall efficiency), while maintaining a high proton conductivity (good electrochemical efficiency) when compared to perfluorinated sulfonic acid membranes such as Nafion. Critically, the membrane provides an extremely low electro-osmotic drag coefficient of approximately one water molecule per proton (versus the 2-3 for Nafion) that minimizes flooding issues at the cathode, which often fatally limit open cathode MEA performance. During this successfully completed DOE program the project team met all of the project goals. The team built and tested over 1,500 MEAs with a wide range of different manufacturing chemistries and process conditions. This project demonstrated that the UNF MEA design could be fabricated with a high degree of reproducibility and repeatability. Some specific achievements include: • Durability - The UNF MEA has demonstrated over 11,000 hours continuous operation in a short stack configuration. The root cause of an off-state degradation issue was successfully mitigated by modifying the manufacturing process by changing the wetting agents used in the catalyst printing. The stability of the anode electrode was increased by replacing the anode electrodes with a stabilized PtRu/C catalyst. The overall degradation rate was significantly reduced through optimization of the MEA operating conditions. • Performance - The project team optimized the performance of the critical MEA sub-components. By increasing the membrane thickness, the methanol crossover was reduced, thereby increasing the fuel utilization efficiency without sacrificing any electrochemical performance. The reduction in methanol crossover increased the fuel utilization efficiency from 78% to over 90%. The liquid barrier layer was optimized to provide improved reproducibility, thereby improving stack voltage uniformity and reliability. Additionally the barrier layer water permeability was lowered without sacrificing any power density, thereby enabling increased operating temperature. Improvements in the cathode catalyst selection and coating provided an additional 10% to 20% improvement in the MEA performance at the target operating range. • Cost - Commercially scalable processes were developed for all of the critical MEA components which led to improved yields and lower overall manufacturing costs. Furthermore, significant steps have been made in improving the process control, which increases MEA uniformity and control of the transport properties to ensure reliable performance. MEAs that were made using these improved process controls showed excellent reproducibility in 40 cell stacks, with as low as ± 6 mV voltage variation between the MEAs at the target 120 to 150 mA/cm2 operating range. Given that the catalyst is an important driver of the MEA cost, the project team has successfully demonstrated that the catalyst loading can be lowered to 3 mg/cm² Pt and excellent durability still be achieved with over 2000 hours of operation. UNF and its project partners have met all of the goals and milestones of this project. Additionally, MEA performance has been validated with a 20 W portable DMFC, which was developed in a separate DOE program.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>University of North Florida</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-09-16</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage>Final</dc:coverage><dc:format>Medium: ED; Size: 3.87 MB</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1092952, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1092952</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE/EE0000475</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>EE0000475</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther/><dc:doi>10.2172/1092952</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-09-26</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1092952</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1092952</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="57"><dc:title>The new barium zinc mercurides Ba{sub 3}ZnHg{sub 10} and BaZn{sub 0.6}Hg{sub 3.4} - Synthesis, crystal and electronic structure</dc:title><dc:creator>Schwarz, Michael; Wendorff, Marco [Institut fuer Anorganische und Analytische Chemie, University of Freiburg, Albertstr. 21, D-79104 Freiburg (Germany)] [Institut fuer Anorganische und Analytische Chemie, University of Freiburg, Albertstr. 21, D-79104 Freiburg (Germany)]; Roehr, Caroline, E-mail: caroline@ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de [Institut fuer Anorganische und Analytische Chemie, University of Freiburg, Albertstr. 21, D-79104 Freiburg (Germany)] [Institut fuer Anorganische und Analytische Chemie, University of Freiburg, Albertstr. 21, D-79104 Freiburg (Germany)]</dc:creator><dc:subject>37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; ATOMS; BARIUM; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; CHEMICAL PREPARATION; COORDINATION NUMBER; CRUCIBLES; CUBIC LATTICES; ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE; INTERMETALLIC COMPOUNDS; MONOCRYSTALS; ORTHORHOMBIC LATTICES; SPACE GROUPS; X RADIATION; ZINC</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>The title compounds Ba{sub 3}ZnHg{sub 10} and BaZn{sub 0.6}Hg{sub 3.4} were synthesized from stoichiometric ratios of the elements in Ta crucibles. Their crystal structures, which both represent new structure types, have been determined using single crystal X-ray data. The structure of Ba{sub 3}ZnHg{sub 10} (orthorhombic, oP28, space group Pmmn, a=701.2(3), b=1706.9(8), c=627.3(3)pm, Z=2, R1=0.0657) contains folded 4{sup 4} Hg nets, where the meshes form the bases of flat rectangular pyramids resembling the structure of BaAl{sub 4}. The flat pyramids are connected via Hg-Zn/Hg bonds, leaving large channels at the folds, in which Ba(1) and Hg(2) atoms alternate. Whereas the remaining Hg/Zn atoms form a covalent 3D network of three- to five-bonded atoms with short M-M distances (273-301 pm; CN 9-11), the Hg(2) atoms in the channels adopt a comparatively large coordination number of 12 and increased distances (317-348 pm) to their Zn/Hg neighbours. In the structure of BaZn{sub 0.6}Hg{sub 3.4} (cubic, cI320, space group I4{sup Macron }3d, a=2025.50(7) pm, Z=64, R1=0.0440), with a chemical composition not much different from that of Ba{sub 3}ZnHg{sub 10}, the Zn/Hg atoms of the mixed positions M(1/2) are arranged in an slightly distorted primitive cubic lattice with a 4 Multiplication-Sign 4 Multiplication-Sign 4 subcell relation to the unit cell. The 24 of the originating 64 cubes contain planar cis tetramers Hg(5,6){sub 4} with Hg in a nearly trigonal planar or tetrahedral coordination. In another 24 of the small cubes, two opposing faces are decorated by Hg(3,4){sub 2} dumbbells, two by Ba(2) atoms respectively. The third type of small cubes are centered by Ba(1) atoms only. The complex 3D polyanionic Hg/Zn network thus formed is compared with the Hg partial structure in Rb{sub 3}Hg{sub 20} applying a group-subgroup relation. Despite their different overall structures, the connectivity of the negatively charged Hg atoms, the rather metallic Zn bonding characteristic (as obtained from FP-LAPW band structure calculations) and the coordination number of 16 for all Ba cations relate the two title compounds. - Graphical abstract: Six of the 64 small sub-cubes of three types (A, B, C) forming the unit cell of the Hg-rich mercuride BaZn{sub 0.6}Hg{sub 3.4}.

These targets were laid out in the DOE’s R&amp;D roadmap to develop an advanced direct methanol fuel cell power supply that meets commercial entry requirements. Such a power supply will enable mobile computers to operate non-stop, unplugged from the wall power outlet, by using the high energy density of methanol fuel contained in a replaceable fuel cartridge. Specifically this project focused on balance-of-plant component integration and miniaturization, as well as extensive component, subassembly and integrated system durability and validation testing. This design has resulted in a pre-production power supply design and a prototype that meet the rigorous demands of consumer electronic applications. PROJECT TASKS The proposed work plan was designed to meet the project objectives, which corresponded directly with the objectives outlined in the Funding Opportunity Announcement: To engineer the fuel cell balance-of-plant and packaging to meet the needs of consumer electronic systems, specifically at power levels required for mobile computing. UNF used existing balance-of-plant component technologies developed under its current US Army CERDEC project, as well as a previous DOE project completed by PolyFuel, to further refine them to both miniaturize and integrate their functionality to increase the system power density and energy density. Benefits of UNF’s novel passive water recycling MEA (membrane electrode assembly) and the simplified system architecture it enabled formed the foundation of the design approach. The package design was hardened to address orientation independence, shock, vibration, and environmental requirements. Fuel cartridge and fuel subsystems were improved to ensure effective fuel containment. PROJECT OVERVIEW The University of North Florida (UNF), with project partner the University of Florida, recently completed the Department of Energy (DOE) project entitled “Advanced Direct Methanol Fuel Cell for Mobile Computing”. The primary objective of the project was to advance portable fuel cell system technology towards the commercial targets as laid out in the DOE R&amp;D roadmap by developing a 20-watt, direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), portable power supply based on the UNF innovative “passive water recovery” MEA. Extensive component, sub-system, and system development and testing was undertaken to meet the rigorous demands of the consumer electronic application. Numerous brassboard (nonpackaged) systems were developed to optimize the integration process and facilitating control algorithm development. The culmination of the development effort was a fully-integrated, DMFC, power supply (referred to as DP4). The project goals were 40 W/kg for specific power, 55 W/l for power density, and 575 Whr/l for energy density. It should be noted that the specific power and power density were for the power section only, and did not include the hybrid battery. The energy density is based on three, 200 ml, fuel cartridges, and also did not include the hybrid battery. The results show that the DP4 system configured without the methanol concentration sensor exceeded all performance goals, achieving 41.5 W/kg for specific power, 55.3 W/l for power density, and 623 Whr/l for energy density. During the project, the DOE revised its technical targets, and the definition of many of these targets, for the portable power application. With this revision, specific power, power density, specific energy (Whr/kg), and energy density are based on the total system, including fuel tank, fuel, and hybridization battery. Fuel capacity is not defined, but the same value is required for all calculations. Test data showed that the DP4 exceeded all 2011 Technical Status values; for example, the DP4 energy density was 373 Whr/l versus the DOE 2011 status of 200 Whr/l. For the DOE 2013 Technical Goals, the operation time was increased from 10 hours to 14.3 hours. Under these conditions, the DP4 closely approached or surpassed the technical targets; for example, the DP4 achieved 468 Whr/l versus the goal of 500 Whr/l. Thus, UNF has successfully met the project goals. A fully-operational, 20-watt DMFC power supply was developed based on the UNF passive water recovery MEA. The power supply meets the project performance goals and advances portable power technology towards the commercialization targets set by the DOE.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>University of North Florida</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-09-03</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage>Final</dc:coverage><dc:format>Medium: ED; Size: 4.82MB.PDF File</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1091798, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1091798</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE/EE0000476</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>EE0000476</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther/><dc:doi>10.2172/1091798</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-09-19</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1091798</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1091798</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="60"><dc:title>ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE SURVEY REPORT FOR WEST BLACK OAK RIDGE, EAST BLACK OAK RIDGE, MCKINNEY RIDGE, WEST PINE RIDGE, AND PARCEL 21D IN THE VICINITY OF THE EAST TENNESSEE TECHNOLOGY PARK, OAK RIDGE, TENNESSEE</dc:title><dc:creator>David A.

The goal is to obtain all media no-further-investigation (NFI) determinations for the subject parcels considering existing soils. To augment the existing soils-only NFI determinations, samples of groundwater, surface water, soil, and sediment were collected to support all media NFI decisions. The only updates presented here are those that were made after the original issuance of the NFI documents. In the subject parcel where the soils NFI determination was not completed for approval (Parcel 21d), the full process has been performed to address the soils as well. Preparation of this report included the detailed search of federal government records, title documents, aerial photos that may reflect prior uses, and visual inspections of the property and adjacent properties. Interviews with current employees involved in, or familiar with, operations on the real property were also conducted to identify any areas on the property where hazardous substances and petroleum products, or their derivatives, and acutely hazardous wastes may have been released or disposed. In addition, a search was made of reasonably obtainable federal, state, and local government records of each adjacent facility where there has been a release of any hazardous substance or any petroleum product or their derivatives, including aviation fuel and motor oil, and which is likely to cause or contribute to a release of any hazardous substance or any petroleum product or its derivatives, including aviation fuel or motor oil, on the real property. A radiological survey and soil/sediment sampling was conducted to assess baseline conditions of Parcel 21d that were not addressed by the soils-only NFI reports. Groundwater sampling was also conducted to support a Parcel 21d decision.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2012-11-29</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1060183, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1060183</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>13-IEAV-0030</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>13-IEAV-0030</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther/><dc:doi>10.2172/1060183</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-02-04</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1060183</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1060183</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="61"><dc:title>H{sub 2}(v = 0,1) + C{sup +}({sup 2} P) {yields} H+CH{sup +} STATE-TO-STATE RATE CONSTANTS FOR CHEMICAL PUMPING MODELS IN ASTROPHYSICAL MEDIA</dc:title><dc:creator>Zanchet, Alexandre; Bulut, Niyazi; Roncero, Octavio [Instituto de Fisica Fundamental (IFF-CSIC), C.S.I.C., Serrano 123, E-28006 Madrid (Spain)] [Instituto de Fisica Fundamental (IFF-CSIC), C.S.I.C., Serrano 123, E-28006 Madrid (Spain)]; Godard, B.; Cernicharo, Jose [Centro de Astrobilogia, CSIC-INTA, Torrejon de Ardoz, Madrid (Spain)] [Centro de Astrobilogia, CSIC-INTA, Torrejon de Ardoz, Madrid (Spain)]; Halvick, Philippe, E-mail: octavio.roncero@csic.es [Institut des Sciences Moleculaires, Universite de Bordeaux, CNRS UMR 5255, 351 cours de la Liberation, F-33405 Talence Cedex (France)] [Institut des Sciences Moleculaires, Universite de Bordeaux, CNRS UMR 5255, 351 cours de la Liberation, F-33405 Talence Cedex (France)]</dc:creator><dc:subject>74 ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS; 79 ASTROPHYSICS, COSMOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY; ASTROPHYSICS; CROSS SECTIONS; DISSOCIATION; ERRORS; EV RANGE; EXCITATION; GROUND STATES; HYDROGEN; PHOTOLYSIS; POTENTIAL ENERGY; PUMPING; RADIANT HEAT TRANSFER; REACTION KINETICS; SURFACE ENERGY; WAVE PACKETS</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>State-to-state rate constants for the title reaction are calculated using the electronic ground state potential energy surface and an accurate quantum wave-packet method.

The simulated reaction cross section for v = 0 shows a rather good agreement with the experimental results of Gerlich et al., both with a threshold of 0.36 eV and within the experimental error of 20%. The total reaction rate coefficients simulated for v = 1 are two times smaller than those estimated by Hierl et al. from cross sections measured at different temperatures and neglecting the contribution from v &gt; 1 with an uncertainty factor of two. Thus, part of the disagreement is attributed to the contributions of v &gt; 1.

This result partially explains the discrepancies previously found with measurements and demonstrates that CH{sup +} excitation is mostly driven by chemical pumping.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/766/2/80</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2013-04-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 766; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: [8 page(s)]</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22167529, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22167529</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; CODEN: ASJOAB; TRN: US13P4482121985</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1088/0004-637X/766/2/80</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-12-05</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22167529</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="62"><dc:title>ESG-CET Final Progress Title</dc:title><dc:creator>Don Middleton</dc:creator><dc:subject>54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; CLIMATE MODELS; CLIMATES; COMPUTERS</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>Drawing to a close after five years of funding from DOE's ASCR and BER program offices, the SciDAC-2 project called the Earth System Grid (ESG) Center for Enabling Technologies has successfully established a new capability for serving data from distributed centers. The system enables users to access, analyze, and visualize data using a globally federated collection of networks, computers and software. The ESG software - now known as the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) - has attracted a broad developer base and has been widely adopted so that it is now being utilized in serving the most comprehensive multi-model climate data sets in the world. The system is used to support international climate model intercomparison activities as well as high profile U.S. DOE, NOAA, NASA, and NSF projects. It currently provides more than 25,000 users access to more than half a petabyte of climate data (from models and from observations) and has enabled over a 1,000 scientific publications.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>National Center For Atmospheric Research</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2011-10-06</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage>Final</dc:coverage><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1026512, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1026512</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE/ER/25772</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>FC02-06ER25772</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US201208%%855</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/1026512</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2012-05-10</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1026512</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1026512</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="63"><dc:title>Advanced Power Batteries for Renewable Energy Applications 3.09</dc:title><dc:creator>Rodney Shane</dc:creator><dc:subject>25 ENERGY STORAGE</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>This report describes the research that was completed under project title â&#128;&#147; Advanced Power Batteries for Renewable Energy Applications 3.09, Award Number DE-EE0001112.

The regulations are based on the acceptable dose rates to which the public, workers, and the environment may be exposed. As such, the regulations specify dose rates, rather than quantity of radioactive isotopes and require monitoring to confirm the requirements are met. 10CFR71.47 requires that each package of radioactive materials offered for transportation must be designed and prepared for shipment so that under conditions normally incident to transportation the radiation level does not exceed 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) at any point on the external Surface of the package, and the transport index does not exceed 10. Before shipment, the dose rate of the package is determined by measurement, ensuring that it conforms to the regulatory limits, regardless of any analyses. This is the requirement for all certified packagings. This paper discusses the requirements for establishing the dose rates when shipping RAM packages and the precedents for meeting these requirements by measurement.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>available</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch>SRS</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>DOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2012-06-05</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Conference</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Conference: Institute of Nuclear Materials Management 53rd Annual Meeting</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1041521, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1041521</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>SRNL-STI-2012-00317</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC09-08SR22470</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US1202665</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi/><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2012-12-05</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1041521</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1041521</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="66"><dc:title>Evidence of Eu{sup 2+} 4f electrons in the valence band spectra of EuTiO{sub 3} and EuZrO{sub 3}</dc:title><dc:creator>Kolodiazhnyi, T.

This document specifies protective actions for public health during the early and intermediate phases and cleanup guidance for the late phase of RDD or IND incidents, and it discusses approaches to implementing the necessary actions. However, while the PAG provides specific guidance for the early and intermediate phases, it prescribes no equivalent guidance for the late-phase cleanup actions. Instead, the PAG offers a general description of a complex process using a site-specific optimization approach. This approach does not predetermine cleanup levels but approaches the problem from the factors that would bear on the final agreed-on cleanup levels. Based on this approach, the decision-making process involves multifaceted considerations including public health, the environment, and the economy, as well as socio-political factors. In an effort to fully define the process and approach to be used in optimizing late-phase recovery and site restoration following an RDD or IND incident, DHS has tasked the NCRP with preparing a comprehensive report addressing all aspects of the optimization process. Preparation of the NCRP report is a three-year (2010-2013) project assigned to a scientific committee, the Scientific Committee (SC) 5-1; the report was initially titled, Approach to Optimizing Decision Making for Late- Phase Recovery from Nuclear or Radiological Terrorism Incidents. Members of SC 5-1 represent a broad range of expertise, including homeland security, health physics, risk and decision analysis, economics, environmental remediation and radioactive waste management, and communication. In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident of 2011, and guided by a recent process led by the White House through a Principal Level Exercise (PLE), the optimization approach has since been expanded to include off-site contamination from major nuclear power plant accidents as well as other nuclear or radiological incidents. The expanded application under the current guidance has thus led to a broadened scope of the report, which is reflected in its new title, Decision Making for Late-Phase Recovery from Nuclear or Radiological Incidents. The NCRP report, which is due for publication in 2013, will substantiate the current DHS guidance by clarifying and elaborating on the processes required for the development and implementation of procedures for optimizing decision making for late-phase recovery, enabling the establishment of cleanup goals on a site-specific basis. The report will contain a series of topics addressing important issues related to the long-term recovery from nuclear or radiological incidents. Special topics relevant to supporting the optimization of the decision-making process will include cost-benefit analysis, radioactive waste management, risk communication, stakeholder interaction, risk assessment, and decontamination approaches and techniques. The committee also evaluated past nuclear and radiological incidents for their relevance to the report, including the emerging issues associated with the Fukushima nuclear accident. Thus, due to the commonality of the late-phase issues (such as the potential widespread contamination following an event), the majority of the information pertaining to the response in the late-phase decision-making period, including site-specific optimization framework and approach, could be used or adapted for use in case of similar situations that are not due to terrorism, such as those that would be caused by major nuclear facility accidents or radiological incidents. To ensure that the report and the NCRP recommendations are current and relevant to the effective implementation of federal guidance, SC 5-1 has actively coordinated with the agencies of interest and other relevant stakeholders throughout the duration of the project. The resulting report will be an important resource to guide those involved in late-phase recovery efforts following a nuclear or radiological incident.

The center received the second round of GATE grant in 2005 under the title “Upgrading the Center for Lightweighting Automotive Materials and Processing”. Using the two grants, the Center has successfully created 10 graduate level courses on lightweight automotive materials, integrated them into master’s and PhD programs in Automotive Systems Engineering, and offered them regularly to the graduate students in the program. In addition, the Center has created a web-based lightweight automotive materials database, conducted research on lightweight automotive materials and organized seminars/symposia on lightweight automotive materials for both academia and industry. The faculty involved with the Center has conducted research on a variety of topics related to design, testing, characterization and processing of lightweight materials for automotive applications and have received numerous research grants from automotive companies and government agencies to support their research.

The thermal decomposition process of the title complex was studied by means of the TG-DTG and DSC at a heating rate of 20 K/min. It consists of two slow endothermic peaks and one violent exothermic peak with 37.22% residues. The apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the complex in thermal decomposition process were calculated by means of the Kissinger method and Ozawa-Doyle method. The thermal decomposition of AP was accelerated due to the catalyst of the complex, it suggests that the complex can provide theoretical support to further performance study as it is added to the propellant formulations to regulate the burning rate. - Graphical abstract: A novel tetra-nuclear Cu complex of ANPyO was synthesized and its molecular structure was measured.

However, DOE-2.1E is a mature program that is no longer supported by LBNL on contract to the USDOE, or by any other public or private entity. With no more significant updates in the modeling capabilities of DOE-2.1E during recent years, DOE-2.1E lacks the ability to model, with the necessary accuracy, a number of building technologies that have the potential to reduce significantly the energy consumption of buildings in California. DOE-2's legacy software code makes it difficult and time consuming to add new or enhance existing modeling features in DOE-2. Therefore the USDOE proposed to develop a new tool, EnergyPlus, which is intended to replace DOE-2 as the next generation building simulation tool. EnergyPlus inherited most of the useful features from DOE-2 and BLAST, and more significantly added new modeling capabilities far beyond DOE-2, BLAST, and other simulations tools currently available. With California's net zero energy goals for new residential buildings in 2020 and for new commercial buildings in 2030, California needs to evaluate and promote currently available best practice and emerging technologies to significantly reduce energy use of buildings for space cooling and heating, ventilating, refrigerating, lighting, and water heating. The California Energy Commission (CEC) needs to adopt a new building energy simulation program for developing and maintaining future versions of Title 24. Therefore, EnergyPlus became a good candidate to CEC for its use in developing and complying with future Title 24 upgrades. In 2004, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company contracted with ArchitecturalEnergy Corporation (AEC), Taylor Engineering, and GARD Analytics to evaluate EnergyPlus in its ability to model those energy efficiency measures specified in both the residential and nonresidential Alternative Calculation Method (ACM) of the Title-24 Standards. The AEC team identified gaps between EnergyPlus modeling capabilities and the requirements of Title 24 and ACMs. AEC's evaluation was based on the 2005 version of Title 24 and ACMs and the version 1.2.1 of EnergyPlus released on October 1, 2004. AEC's evaluation is useful for understanding the functionality and technical merits of EnergyPlus for implementing the performance-based compliance methods described in the ACMs. However, it did not study the performance of EnergyPlus in actually making building energy simulations for both the standard and proposed building designs, as is required for any software program to be certified by the CEC for use in doing Title-24 compliance calculations. In 2005, CEC funded LBNL to evaluate the use of EnergyPlus for compliance calculations by comparing the ACM accuracy test runs between DOE-2.1E and EnergyPlus. LBNL team identified key technical issues that must be addressed before EnergyPlus can be considered by the CEC for use in developing future Nonresidential Title-24 Standards or as an ACM tool. With Title 24 being updated to the 2008 version (which adds new requirements to the standards and ACMs), and EnergyPlus having been through several update cycles from version 1.2.1 to 2.1, it becomes crucial to review and update the previously identified gaps of EnergyPlus for use in Title 24, and more importantly to close the gaps which would help pave the way for EnergyPlus to be adopted as a Title 24 compliance ACM. With this as the key driving force, CEC funded LBNL in 2008 through this PIER (Public Interest Energy Research) project with the overall technical goal to expand development of EnergyPlus to provide for its use in Title-24 standard compliance and by CEC staff.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA (US)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>Environmental Energy Technologies Division</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2008-03-28</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED; Size: 34</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 944980, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 944980</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>LBNL-822E</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC02-05CH11231</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US200902%%1172</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/944980</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2009-02-02</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>944980</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/944980</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="78"><dc:title>Structural and conductivity studies of CsK(SO{sub 4}){sub 0.32}(SeO{sub 4}){sub 0.68}Te(OH){sub 6}</dc:title><dc:creator>Djemel, M., E-mail: jmal_manel@yahoo.fr [Laboratoire de Chimie Inorganique, Universite de Sfax, Faculte des Sciences de Sfax, BP 1171, 3000 Sfax (Tunisia)]; Abdelhedi, M., E-mail: m_abdelhedi2002@yahoo.fr [Laboratoire de Chimie Inorganique, Universite de Sfax, Faculte des Sciences de Sfax, BP 1171, 3000 Sfax (Tunisia); Laboratoire Leon Brouillon, CE/Saclay, 91191 Gif-Sur-Yvette Cedex (France)]; Zouari, N., E-mail: bizrirl@yahoo.fr [Laboratoire de l'Etat solide, Universite de Sfax, Faculte des Sciences de Sfax, BP 1171, 3000 Sfax (Tunisia)]; Dammak, M., E-mail: meddammak@yahoo.fr [Laboratoire de Chimie Inorganique, Universite de Sfax, Faculte des Sciences de Sfax, BP 1171, 3000 Sfax (Tunisia)]; Kolsi, A.W., E-mail: kolsi_abdelhwaheb@yahoo.fr [Laboratoire de Chimie Inorganique, Universite de Sfax, Faculte des Sciences de Sfax, BP 1171, 3000 Sfax (Tunisia)]</dc:creator><dc:subject>36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; CALORIMETRY; CRYSTALS; DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES; MONOCLINIC LATTICES; PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS; POTASSIUM COMPLEXES; SELENATES; SPACE GROUPS; SULFATES; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; THERMAL ANALYSIS; X-RAY DIFFRACTION; X-RAY DIFFRACTOMETERS</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>The compound CsK(SO{sub 4}){sub 0.32}(SeO{sub 4}){sub 0.68}Te(OH){sub 6} crystallizes in the monoclinic P2{sub 1}/n space group.

Preparation of this report included the detailed search of federal government records, title documents, aerial photos that may reflect prior uses, and visual inspections of the property and adjacent properties. Interviews with current employees involved in, or familiar with, operations on the real property were also conducted to identify any areas on the property where hazardous substances and petroleum products, or their derivatives, and acutely hazardous wastes may have been released or disposed. In addition, a search was made of reasonably obtainable federal, state, and local government records of each adjacent facility where there has been a release of any hazardous substance or any petroleum product or their derivatives, including aviation fuel and motor oil, and which is likely to cause or contribute to a release of any hazardous substance or any petroleum product or its derivatives, including aviation fuel or motor oil, on the real property. A radiological survey and soil/sediment sampling was conducted to assess baseline conditions of Parcel 21d that were not addressed by the soils-only no-further-investigation (NFI) reports. Groundwater sampling was also conducted to support a Parcel 21d decision. Based on available data West Black Oak Ridge, East Black Oak Ridge, McKinney Ridge, and West Pine Ridge are not impacted by site operations and are not subject to actions per the Federal Facility Agreement (FFA). This determination is supported by visual inspections, records searches and interviews, groundwater conceptual modeling, approved NFI reports, analytical data, and risk analysis results. Parcel 21d data, however, demonstrate impacts from site operations, specifically as associated with lead in surface soil at the abandoned water tank and nickel in surface soils over the northern portion of the parcel from former Bldg. K-1037 smelting operations. Low level detections of organics are also reported in some surface soils including Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) near Blair Road and common laboratory contaminants at randomly distributed locations. However, human health risk from site-related contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) are acceptable?though maximum concentrations of lead and nickel and the screening-level ecological risk assessment (SLERA) demonstrate no further ecological evaluation is warranted. The weight of evidence leads to the conclusion Parcel 21d does not require any actions per the FFA.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM) (United States)</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2012-11-29</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1060157, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1060157</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE/OR/01-2531&amp;amp;D212; IEAV-1544</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC05-06OR23100</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US1300342</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/1060157</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-04-03</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1060157</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1060157</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="82"><dc:title>QUASI-PERIODIC FAST-MODE WAVE TRAINS WITHIN A GLOBAL EUV WAVE AND SEQUENTIAL TRANSVERSE OSCILLATIONS DETECTED BY SDO/AIA</dc:title><dc:creator>Liu Wei; Nitta, Nariaki V.; Aschwanden, Markus J.; Schrijver, Carolus J.; Title, Alan M.; Tarbell, Theodore D.

These wave trains, running ahead of the lateral coronal mass ejection (CME) front of 2-4 times slower, coherently travel to distances {approx}&gt; R{sub Sun }/2 along the solar surface, with initial velocities up to 1400 km s{sup -1} decelerating to {approx}650 km s{sup -1}. The rapid expansion of the CME initiated at an elevated height of 110 Mm produces a strong downward and lateral compression, which may play an important role in driving the primary EUV wave and shaping its front forwardly inclined toward the solar surface. The wave trains have a dominant 2 minute periodicity that matches the X-ray flare pulsations, suggesting a causal connection. The arrival of the leading EUV wave front at increasing distances produces an uninterrupted chain sequence of deflections and/or transverse (likely fast kink mode) oscillations of local structures, including a flux-rope coronal cavity and its embedded filament with delayed onsets consistent with the wave travel time at an elevated (by {approx}50%) velocity within it. This suggests that the EUV wave penetrates through a topological separatrix surface into the cavity, unexpected from CME-caused magnetic reconfiguration. These observations, when taken together, provide compelling evidence of the fast-mode MHD wave nature of the primary (outer) fast component of a global EUV wave, running ahead of the secondary (inner) slow component of CME-caused restructuring.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/753/1/52</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2012-07-01</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 753; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: [17 page(s)]</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22036924, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22036924</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; CODEN: ASJOAB; TRN: US12Q0276126660</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1088/0004-637X/753/1/52</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-04-12</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22036924</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="83"><dc:title>Synthesis, characterization, and anomalous dielectric and conductivity performance of one-dimensional (bdaH)InSe{sub 2} (bda = 1,4-butanediamine)</dc:title><dc:creator>Du, Ke-Zhao; Hu, Wan-Biao [State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002 (China) [State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002 (China)]; Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049 (China)]; Hu, Bing; Guan, Xiang-Feng [State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002 (China)] [State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002 (China)]; Huang, Xiao-Ying, E-mail: xyhuang@fjirsm.ac.cn [State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002 (China)] [State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002 (China)]</dc:creator><dc:subject>36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; CRYSTALS; DIELECTRIC MATERIALS; INDIUM SELENIDES; ORTHORHOMBIC LATTICES; PERMITTIVITY; PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS; SPACE GROUPS; SPECTROSCOPY; SYNTHESIS; X-RAY DIFFRACTION</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>Graphical abstract: Anomalous dielectric and conductivity performance have been observed in the organic-containing indium selenide (bdaH)InSe{sub 2}, which are attributed to the water molecules existing in the crystal boundary rather than phase transition.

The organic [bdaH]{sup +} cations are joined into a supramolecular one-dimensional chain via N-H...N hydrogen bonding, which further interacts with the inorganic chain via N-H...Se and C-H...Se hydrogen bonding, forming a supramolecular three-dimensional network. Based on such a well-defined structure, the thermal stability, optical, conductivity, and dielectric properties were systematically investigated, showing that dielectric constant, as well as conductivity, had a hump at about 95 {sup o}C, which could be attributed to water molecules in the crystal boundary.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.materresbull.2011.07.020</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2011-11-15</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Materials Research Bulletin; Journal Volume: 46; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1969-1974</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22210117, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22210117</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0025-5408; CODEN: MRBUAC; Other: PII: S0025-5408(11)00335-7; TRN: US12R1066031043</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1016/J.MATERRESBULL.2011.07.020</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-03-27</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22210117</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="84"><dc:title>A novel organic–inorganic hybrid with Anderson type polyanions as building blocks: (C{sub 6}H{sub 10}N{sub 3}O{sub 2}){sub 2}Na(H{sub 2}O){sub 2}[Al(OH){sub 6}Mo{sub 6}O{sub 18}]·6H{sub 2}O</dc:title><dc:creator>Thabet, Safa, E-mail: safathabet@hotmail.fr [Laboratoire de matériaux et cristallochimie, Département de chimie, Institut Supérieur des Sciences Appliquées et Technologier, Avenue El Mourouj, 5111 Mahdia (Tunisia)] [Laboratoire de matériaux et cristallochimie, Département de chimie, Institut Supérieur des Sciences Appliquées et Technologier, Avenue El Mourouj, 5111 Mahdia (Tunisia)]; Ayed, Brahim, E-mail: brahimayed@yahoo.fr [Laboratoire de matériaux et cristallochimie, Département de chimie, Institut Supérieur des Sciences Appliquées et Technologier, Avenue El Mourouj, 5111 Mahdia (Tunisia)] [Laboratoire de matériaux et cristallochimie, Département de chimie, Institut Supérieur des Sciences Appliquées et Technologier, Avenue El Mourouj, 5111 Mahdia (Tunisia)]; Haddad, Amor [Laboratoire de matériaux et cristallochimie, Département de chimie, Institut Supérieur des Sciences Appliquées et Technologier, Avenue El Mourouj, 5111 Mahdia (Tunisia)] [Laboratoire de matériaux et cristallochimie, Département de chimie, Institut Supérieur des Sciences Appliquées et Technologier, Avenue El Mourouj, 5111 Mahdia (Tunisia)]</dc:creator><dc:subject>36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; ABSORPTION; ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; CATALYSIS; CRYSTAL STRUCTURE; ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY; INFRARED SPECTRA; INTERACTIONS; MONOCRYSTALS; SPACE GROUPS; THERMAL GRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS; X-RAY DIFFRACTION</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>Graphical abstract: Display Omitted Highlights: ► Synthesis of a novel inorganic–organic hybrid compound based on Anderson polyoxomolybdates. ► Characterization by X-ray diffraction, IR and UV–Vis spectroscopies of the new compound. ► Potential applications in catalysis, biochemical analysis and electrical conductivity of the organic–inorganic compound. -- Abstract: A new organic–inorganic hybrid compound based on Anderson polyoxomolybdates, (C{sub 6}H{sub 10}N{sub 3}O{sub 2}){sub 2}Na(H{sub 2}O){sub 2}[Al(OH){sub 6}Mo{sub 6}O{sub 18}]·6H{sub 2}O (1) have been isolated by the conventional solution method and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared, ultraviolet spectroscopy and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA).

Hydrogen bonding utilizing the H atoms of the dication is found to favor certain molecular conformations in the salt, which are significantly different from those found as bound in the enzyme. Ligand docking studies starting from either of these dications or related neutral structures successfully place the conformationally revised structures in the enzyme active site but only under particular hydrogen-bonding and molecular flexibility criteria. Density functional theory calculations verify the energy similarity of the indendent cations and confirm the significant energy cost of the required conformation change to the enzyme bound form. The results suggest the using crystallographically determined free ligand coordinates as starting parameters for modelling may have serious limitations.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY (BNL)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE SC OFFICE OF SCIENCE (SC)</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2011-12-31</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Acta Crystallographica Section C; Journal Volume: 66</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: o527 - o530</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1042285, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1042285</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>BNL--97963-2012-JA</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC02-98CH10886</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US201212%%696</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi/><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2012-12-05</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1042285</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="87"><dc:title>A METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE DOSE RATE FOR BOUNDING MASS LIMITS IN A 9977 PACKAGING</dc:title><dc:creator>Abramczyk, G.; Bellamy, S.; Nathan, S.; Loftin, B.</dc:creator><dc:subject>11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; DOSE RATES; FISSILE MATERIALS; ISOTOPES; M CODES; MASS; MEETINGS; NEUTRON SOURCES; PACKAGING; PACKAGING RULES; RADIATION TRANSPORT; TRANSPORT REGULATIONS; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>The Small Gram Quantity (SGQ) concept is based on the understanding that the hazards associated with the shipment of a radioactive material are directly proportional to its mass. This study describes a methodology that estimates the acceptable masses for several neutron and gamma emitting isotopes that can be shipped in a 9977 Package compliant with the Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 71 (10CFR71) external radiation level limits. 10CFR71.33 states that a shipping application identifies the radioactive and fissile materials at their maximum quantity and provides an evaluation demonstrating compliance with the external radiation standards. Since rather small amounts of some isotopes emit sufficiently strong radiation to produce a large external dose rate, quantifying of the dose rate for a proposed content is a challenging issue for the SGQ approach. It is essential to quantify external radiation levels from several common gamma and neutron sources that can be safely placed in a specific packaging, to ensure compliance with federal regulations. A methodology was established for determining the dose rate for bounding mass limits for a set of isotopes in the Model 9977 Shipping Package. Calculations were performed to estimate external radiation levels using the MCNP radiation transport code to develop a set of response multipliers (Green's functions) for 'dose per source particle' for each neutron and photon spectral group. The source spectrum from one gram of each isotope was folded with the response multipliers to generate the dose rate per gram of each isotope in the 9977 shipping package and its associated shielded containers. The maximum amount of a single isotope that could be shipped within the regulatory limits for dose rate at the surface was determined. For a package containing a mixture of isotopes, the acceptability for shipment can be determined by a sum of fractions approach. Furthermore, the results of this analysis can be easily extended to additional radioisotopes by simply evaluating the neutron and/or photon spectra of those isotopes and folding the spectral data with the Green's functions provided.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>available</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch>SRS</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>DOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2012-05-24</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Conference</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Conference: INMM Annual Meeting</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1046161, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1046161</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>SRNL-STI-2012-00316</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC09-08SR22470</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US1203927</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi/><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2012-12-05</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1046161</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1046161</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="88"><dc:title>Final Report for research grant entitled "Development of Reagents for Application of At-211 and Bi-213 to Targeted Radiotherapy of Cancer"</dc:title><dc:creator>Wilbur, D.

The objective of the studies was to continue in vivo evaluation of reagents to determine which changes in structure were most favorable for in vivo use. The focus of our studies was development and optimization of reagents for pretargeting alpha-emitting radionuclides At-211 or Bi-213 to cancer cells. Testing of the reagents was conducted in vitro and in animal model systems. During the funding period, all three specific aims set out in the proposed studies were worked on, and some additional studies directed at development of a method for direct labeling of proteins with At-211 were investigated. We evaluated reagents in two different approaches in 'two step' pretargeting protocols. These approaches are: (1) delivery of the radionuclide on recombinant streptavidin to bind with pretargeted biotinylated monoclonal antibody (mAb), and alternatively, (2) delivery of the radionuclide on a biotin derivative to bind with pretargeted antibody-streptavidin conjugates. The two approaches were investigated as it was unclear which will be superior for the short half-lived alpha-emitting radionuclides.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>University of Washington</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE Office of Science</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2011-12-23</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage>Final</dc:coverage><dc:format>Medium: ED; Size: 5.3 Megabytes</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1032020, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1032020</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE/ER63789- Final Report</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>FG02-04ER63789</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US1204358</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/1032020</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2012-09-17</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1032020</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1032020</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="89"><dc:title>Full differentiation and assignment of boron species in the electrolytes Li{sub 2}B{sub 6}O{sub 9}F{sub 2} and Li{sub 2}B{sub 3}O{sub 4}F{sub 3} by solid-state {sup 11}B NMR spectroscopy</dc:title><dc:creator>Braeuniger, Thomas, E-mail: T.Braeuniger@fkf.mpg.de [Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstrasse 1, 70569 Stuttgart (Germany)] [Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstrasse 1, 70569 Stuttgart (Germany)]; Pilz, Thomas; Chandran, C.

Here, we describe the characterisation of these compounds by solid-state {sup 11}B NMR spectroscopy. The complex central-transition MAS spectra, resulting from overlap of sub-spectra contributed by the individual boron species in the crystal structures, could be clearly separated by acquisition and analysis of 3QMAS spectra. By numerical fit of these sub-spectra, the isotropic chemical shift {delta}{sub iso}, the quadrupolar coupling constant {chi}, and the asymmetry {eta} were determined. Using known relations between boron coordination and chemical shift as well as quadrupolar coupling, the individual {sup 11}B NMR resonances have been ascribed to boron species in tetrahedral or trigonal environment. To remove remaining assignment ambiguities, the response of the {sup 11}B resonances to {sup 19}F decoupling was qualitatively analysed. Thus, by using the combined information conveyed by chemical shift, quadrupolar and dipolar interaction, a complete assignment of the complex {sup 11}B line shapes exhibited by the fluorooxoborates has been achieved. - Graphical abstract: Structure and solid-state {sup 11}B NMR spectrum of Li{sub 2}B{sub 3}O{sub 4}F{sub 3}.

The applicability of the requirements is based on the Laboratory's potential to emit 100 tons per year of suspended particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, or volatile organic compounds. Additionally, on April 30, 2004, LANL was issued a Title V Operating Permit from the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality Bureau, under 20.2.70 NMAC. Modification Number 1 to this Title V Operating Permit was issued on June 15, 2006 (Permit No P-100M1) and includes emission limits and operating limits for all regulated sources of air pollution at LANL. The Title V Operating Permit also requires semi-annual emissions reporting for all sources included in the permit. This report summarizes both the annual emissions inventory reporting and the semi-annual emissions reporting for LANL for calendar year 2006. LANL's 2006 emissions are well below the emission limits in the Title V Operating Permit.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2007-09-28</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 920237, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 920237</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>LA-14344-SR</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC52-06NA25396</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US200825%%454</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/920237</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2011-02-28</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>920237</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/920237</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="93"><dc:title>THE 2011 FEBRUARY 15 X2 FLARE, RIBBONS, CORONAL FRONT, AND MASS EJECTION: INTERPRETING THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL VIEWS FROM THE SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY AND STEREO GUIDED BY MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC FLUX-ROPE MODELING</dc:title><dc:creator>Schrijver, Carolus J.; Title, Alan M.

These observations enable us to see expanding loops from a flux-rope-like structure over the shearing polarity-inversion line between the central {delta}-spot groups of AR 11158, developing a propagating coronal front ('EIT wave'), and eventually forming the coronal mass ejection moving into the inner heliosphere. The observations support the interpretation that all of these features, including the 'EIT wave', are signatures of an expanding volume traced by loops (much larger than the flux rope only), surrounded by a moving front rather than predominantly wave-like perturbations; this interpretation is supported by previously published MHD models for active-region and global scales. The lateral expansion of the eruption is limited to the local helmet-streamer structure and halts at the edges of a large-scale domain of connectivity (in the process exciting loop oscillations at the edge of the southern polar coronal hole). The AIA observations reveal that plasma warming occurs within the expansion front as it propagates over quiet Sun areas. This warming causes dimming in the 171 A (Fe IX and Fe X) channel and brightening in the 193 and 211 A (Fe XII-XIV) channels along the entire front, while there is weak 131 A (Fe VIII and Fe XXI) emission in some directions. An analysis of the AIA response functions shows that sections of the front running over the quiet Sun are consistent with adiabatic warming; other sections may require additional heating which MHD modeling suggests could be caused by Joule dissipation. Although for the events studied here the effects of volumetric expansion are much more obvious than true wave phenomena, we discuss how different magnetic environments within and around the erupting region can lead to the signatures of either or both of these aspects.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/738/2/167</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2011-09-10</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 738; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/738/2/167; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: 23 pages</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 21584858, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 21584858</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; TRN: US12O2879062993</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1088/0004-637X/738/2/167; COUNTRY OF INPUT: INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA)</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2012-12-11</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>21584858</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="94"><dc:title>Lithium cobalt(II) pyrophosphate, Li[subscript 1.86]CoP[subscript 2]O[subscript 7], from synchrotron X-ray powder data</dc:title><dc:creator>Zhou, Hui; Upreti, Shailesh; Chernova, Natasha A.; Whittingham, M.Stanley (SUNY-Binghamton)</dc:creator><dc:subject>58 GEOSCIENCES; CATIONS; CHEMISTRY; DIFFRACTION; LITHIUM; MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY; SYNCHROTRONS; VALENCE</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>Structure refinement of high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction data of the title compound gave the composition Li{sub 1.865}CoP{sub 2}O{sub 7}, which is also verified by the ICP measurement.

The rapid cooling of the inside surface of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) causes thermal stresses that can combine with stresses caused by high pressure. The aggregate effect of these stresses is an increase in the potential for fracture if a pre-existing flaw is present in a material susceptible to brittle failure. The ferritic, low alloy steel of the reactor vessel beltline adjacent to the core, where neutron radiation gradually embrittles the material over the lifetime of the plant, can be susceptible to brittle fracture. The PTS rule, described in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Section 50.61 (§50.61), “Fracture Toughness Requirements for Protection against Pressurized Thermal Shock Events,” adopted on July 23, 1985, establishes screening criteria to ensure that the potential for a reactor vessel to fail due to a PTS event is deemed to be acceptably low. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) completed a research program that concluded that the risk of through-wall cracking due to a PTS event is much lower than previously estimated. The NRC subsequently developed a rule, §50.61a, published on January 4, 2010, entitled “Alternate Fracture Toughness Requirements for Protection Against Pressurized Thermal Shock Events” (75 FR 13). Use of the new rule by licensees is optional. The §50.61a rule differs from §50.61 in that it requires licensees who choose to follow this alternate method to analyze the results from periodic volumetric examinations required by the ASME Code, Section XI, Rules for Inservice Inspection (ISI) of Nuclear Power Plants. These analyses are intended to determine if the actual flaw density and size distribution in the licensee’s reactor vessel beltline welds are bounded by the flaw density and size distribution values used in the PTS technical basis. Under a contract with the NRC, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has been working on a program to assess the ability of current inservice inspection (ISI)-ultrasonic testing (UT) techniques, as qualified through ASME Code, Appendix VIII, Supplements 4 and 6, to detect small fabrication or inservice-induced flaws located in RPV welds and adjacent base materials. As part of this effort, the investigators have pursued an evaluation, based on the available information, of the capability of UT to provide flaw density/distribution inputs for making RPV weld assessments in accordance with §50.61a. This paper presents the results of an evaluation of data from the 1993 Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Unit 3, Spirit of Appendix VIII reactor vessel examination, a comparison of the flaw density/distribution from this data with the distribution in §50.61a, possible reasons for differences, and plans and recommendations for further work in this area.</dc:description><dcq:publisher>American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New York, NY, United States(US).</dcq:publisher><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (US)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2012-09-17</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Conference</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Conference: Proceedings of the ASME Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference (PVP2011), July 17-21, 2011, Baltimore, Maryland, Paper No. PVP2011-58045</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1053386, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1053386</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>PNNL-SA-78361</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>AC05-76RL01830</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>Other: 401001060</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi/><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-12-05</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1053386</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="97"><dc:title>Synthesis, structure, growth and characterization of a novel organic NLO single crystal: Morpholin-4-ium p-aminobenzoate</dc:title><dc:creator>Shanmugam, G.

The molecular structure of the compound was solved and refined by Direct Methods using SHELXS97 and full-matrix least-squares technique using SHELXL97, respectively. MPABA crystallizes in a monoclinic system with unit cell parameters, a = 5.948(5) Å, b = 18.033(4) Å, c = 10.577(5) Å, β = 90.40(1)° and non-centrosymmetric space group Cc. The experimentally measured density and chemical compositions were found to be in good agreement with the theoretical values. The phases and functional groups of MPABA have been identified and confirmed through powder X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies, respectively. The thermal stability and decomposition details were studied through TG/DTA thermograms. The UV–visible transmission spectra were recorded for the grown crystal and its NLO characteristic was explored by powder second harmonic generation (SHG) studies.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability>Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.materresbull.2012.05.037</dcq:publisherAvailability><dcq:publisherResearch/><dcq:publisherSponsor/><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2012-09-15</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Journal Article</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Journal Name: Materials Research Bulletin; Journal Volume: 47; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2315-2323</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 22215724, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 22215724</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport/><dcq:identifierDOEcontract/><dc:identifierOther>Journal ID: ISSN 0025-5408; CODEN: MRBUAC; Other: PII: S0025-5408(12)00413-8; TRN: US13R1642036687</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.1016/J.MATERRESBULL.2012.05.037</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2014-04-14</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>22215724</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type=""/><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="98"><dc:title>An unusual 3D interdigitated architecture assembled from Keggin polyoxometalates and dinuclear copper(II) complexes</dc:title><dc:creator>Pang, Haijun; Yang, Ming; Kang, Lu [Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Engineering and Technology of College of Heilongjiang Province, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin 150040 (China)] [Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Engineering and Technology of College of Heilongjiang Province, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin 150040 (China)]; Ma, Huiyuan, E-mail: mahy017@nenu.edu.cn [Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Engineering and Technology of College of Heilongjiang Province, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin 150040 (China)] [Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Engineering and Technology of College of Heilongjiang Province, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin 150040 (China)]; Liu, Bo, E-mail: liubo200400@vip.sina.com [Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Engineering and Technology of College of Heilongjiang Province, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin 150040 (China)] [Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Engineering and Technology of College of Heilongjiang Province, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin 150040 (China)]; Li, Shaobin; Liu, Heng [Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Engineering and Technology of College of Heilongjiang Province, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin 150040 (China)] [Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Engineering and Technology of College of Heilongjiang Province, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin 150040 (China)]</dc:creator><dc:subject>36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; ANTIFERROMAGNETISM; COPPER; COPPER SULFIDES; HYDROGEN PEROXIDE; INFRARED SPECTRA; INTERACTIONS; LAYERS; MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY; MONOCRYSTALS; THERMAL GRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS; WATER; X-RAY DIFFRACTION</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated/><dc:description>A novel organic-inorganic hybrid compound, [Cu{sub 2}(bipy){sub 3}({mu}{sub 1}-H{sub 2}O){sub 2}({mu}{sub 2}-H{sub 2}O)({mu}{sub 2}-OH)(H{sub 2}BW{sub 12}O{sub 40})]{center_dot}4 H{sub 2}O (1) (bipy=4,4 Prime -bipy), has been synthesized in hydrothermal condition and characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectrum, TG analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

Brief Description of Revision: A complete revision to reflect a recent change in name for the NTS; changes in name for some tenant organizations; and to update references to current DOE policies, orders, and guidance documents. Article 237.2 was deleted. Appendix 3B was updated. Article 411.2 was modified. Article 422 was re-written to reflect the wording of DOE O 458.1. Article 431.6.d was modified. The glossary was updated. This manual contains the radiological control requirements to be used for all radiological activities conducted by programs under the purview of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO). Compliance with these requirements will ensure compliance with Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 835, &amp;#x27;Occupational Radiation Protection.&amp;#x27; Programs covered by this manual are located at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS); Nellis Air Force Base and North Las Vegas, Nevada; Santa Barbara and Livermore, California; and Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. In addition, fieldwork by NNSA/NSO at other locations is covered by this manual. Current activities at NNSS include operating low-level radioactive and mixed waste disposal facilities for United States defense-generated waste, assembly and execution of subcritical experiments, assembly/disassembly of special experiments, the storage and use of special nuclear materials, performing criticality experiments, emergency responder training, surface cleanup and site characterization of contaminated land areas, environmental activity by the University system, and nonnuclear test operations, such as controlled spills of hazardous materials at the Hazardous Materials Spill Center. Currently, the major potential for occupational radiation exposure is associated with the burial of low-level radioactive waste and the handling of radioactive sources. Remediation of contaminated land areas may also result in radiological exposures.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>Nevada Test Site/National Security Technologies, LLC (United States)</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2012-03-26</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation>Related Information: This version includes a change notice.</dc:relation><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1036978, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1036978</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>DOE/NV/25946--801 Revision 2</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>DE-AC52-06NA25946</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>TRN: US1201631</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi>10.2172/1036978</dc:doi><dc:rights/><dc:dateEntry>2013-07-18</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1036978</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="application/pdf">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1036978</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record><record rownumber="100"><dc:title>Smart-Grid Security Issues</dc:title><dc:creator>Khurana, Himanshu; Hadley, Mark D.; Lu, Ning; Frincke, Deborah A.</dc:creator><dc:subject>24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; SECURITY; PLANNING; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IEEE; cyber security</dc:subject><dc:subjectRelated>IEEE; cyber security</dc:subjectRelated><dc:description>TITLE: Smart-Grid Security Issues (Editorial Material, English) IEEE SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY 8 (1).
